# TicTacToe

- The ultimate version of very famious game!
- Finally working!
- Doens't have AI opponents yet!
- Doesn't work in Windows (and probably won't work on MacOS either)!

## WHAT IS IT?
It's a console version of Tic-Tac-Toe game with some additions. In this version you can change size of the field. If you made a field 5x5 or larger (by default it's a 13x13) then number of symbols that needs to be in one line to win is 5 (not 3 like in classic one). Right now game doesn't support any computer opponents or some kind of online competition. So if you want to play then you have to play localy on one machine like in good old days.

## HOW TO PLAY?

1. Run *game.py* by using the command 
```bash
python game.py
```
2. Make your move by simply defining adress of the cell that you want to put your symbol to. First page will help you out.
3. Wait for your opponent to make a move.
4. The fisrt one who made line of 5 symbols in any direction is win.
